# How-To Dotnet

https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-client-dotnet

$ dotnet new console
$ dotnet restore
$ dotnet add package Hashicorp.Vault

Nothing in this repository is useful or worthwhile. Most of my uni classes focus on programming in C#, so I plan on building this out at some point in the future to supplement some of the knowledge from my classes.

Presently this just serves as a quick reference for minor pieces of code and further vault dotnet-related chicken scratches.

If you try to run any of the code and it works I'll be surprised.
